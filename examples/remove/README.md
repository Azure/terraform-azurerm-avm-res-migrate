# Remove Replication Example

This example demonstrates how to remove/disable VM replication using the `remove` operation mode.

## Overview

The remove operation disables protection for a replicated VM and removes it from the replication vault. This is useful when:

- You want to stop replicating a VM
- The migration is complete and cleanup is needed
- You need to reconfigure replication from scratch

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, you need:

1. An existing protected item (replicated VM) in a replication vault
2. The full ARM resource ID of the protected item

## Usage

1. Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`
2. Update the values with your protected item details
3. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

## Force Remove

The `force_remove` option should be used with caution. It forces the removal even if the protected item is in an inconsistent state, which may leave orphaned resources.

```hcl
# Example: Remove VM Replication
# This example demonstrates how to remove/disable replication for a protected item
#

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.9"

  required_providers {
    azapi = {
      source  = "azure/azapi"
      version = "~> 2.4"
    }
  }
}

provider "azapi" {}

# Remove replication for a protected item
module "remove_replication" {
  source = "../../"

  location         = var.location
  name             = "remove-replication"
  parent_id        = var.parent_id
  force_remove     = var.force_remove
  operation_mode   = "remove"
  tags             = var.tags
  target_object_id = var.target_object_id
}
```

## Resources

No resources.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### <a name="input_parent_id"></a> [parent\_id](#input\_parent\_id)

Description: The resource ID of the resource group where the replication vault exists. Format: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_force_remove"></a> [force\_remove](#input\_force\_remove)

Description: Specifies whether the replication needs to be force removed. Use with caution as force removal may leave resources in an inconsistent state.

Type: `bool`

Default: `false`

### <a name="input_location"></a> [location](#input\_location)

Description: Optional: The Azure region where resources will be deployed. If not specified, uses the resource group's location.

Type: `string`

Default: `"westus2"`

### <a name="input_tags"></a> [tags](#input\_tags)

Description: Tags to apply to the resources

Type: `map(string)`

Default: `{}`

### <a name="input_target_object_id"></a> [target\_object\_id](#input\_target\_object\_id)

Description: The protected item ARM ID for which replication needs to be disabled. Format: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.DataReplication/replicationVaults/{vault-name}/protectedItems/{item-name}

Type: `string`

Default: `"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-migrate-project-rg/providers/Microsoft.DataReplication/replicationVaults/myprojectreplicationvault/protectedItems/my-vm-name"`

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

### <a name="output_protected_item_info"></a> [protected\_item\_info](#output\_protected\_item\_info)

Description: Information about the protected item before removal

### <a name="output_removal_operation_headers"></a> [removal\_operation\_headers](#output\_removal\_operation\_headers)

Description: Response headers from the removal operation (includes Azure-AsyncOperation and Location for job tracking)

### <a name="output_removal_status"></a> [removal\_status](#output\_removal\_status)

Description: Status of the replication removal operation

## Modules

The following Modules are called:

### <a name="module_remove_replication"></a> [remove\_replication](#module\_remove\_replication)
