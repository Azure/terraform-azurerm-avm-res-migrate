# This example requires external dependencies that cannot be created/destroyed atomically:
# - Existing Azure Migrate project with registered appliances
# - An active replication (protected item) in a healthy state
# - Source VM that can be shut down during migration
# - Target Azure Stack HCI cluster ready to receive the migrated VM
#
# Migration is a destructive operation that moves VMs from source to target,
# making this example unsuitable for automated e2e testing.
